							<h1>EGR121 - Engineering Innovation</h1>
							<h2>August 2019 - December 2019</h2>
							<p><strong>This is a collection of my work from my introductory mechanical engineering design class. The class consisted of
							design challenges and competitions that helped us work collaboratively and develop our techinical skills.</strong></p>
							<hr />
								<h2>Alarm Clock Disassembly</h2>
									<p>We were assigned to take apart alarm clocks in groups and document the disassembly process, develop a bill of materials (BOM), 
									draw exploded views, and suggest design improvements for cost reduction and increased functionality.</p>
								<h2>Mech Machines</h2>
									<p>Our challenge was to transport a balloon (imagined to be a "warhead") 60 feet into an acrylic box (the "disarmment chamber"). We had to stay outside of a boundary and 
									could not come within 10 feet of the balloon. If the balloon hit any part of our solution device or the ground, or the outside of the disarmament chamber, the attempt
									was considered a failure. We had four attempts and the highest three attempts were scored based on how fast we completed the disarmament.</p>
								<h2>Happy Meal Toy</h2>
									<p>In teams of 3 or 4, we designed, created, and analyzed a Happy Meal toy. We learned how to use SolidWorks, tolerance parts for different types of fits,
									3D print prototypes, create dimensioned drawings, design for manufacturing, account for manufacturing costs and perform market analysis.</p>
								<h2>Rube Golberg</h2>
									<p>As our final project, the class was split into two groups of 12 and each group made a themed Rube Golberg machine. Each team consisted of 4 subgroups, and each subgroup's
									components had include two electronic circuits, one Arduino circuit, a variety  of sensors, and a machined component.</p>
