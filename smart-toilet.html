							<h1>Smart Toilet</h1>
							<h2>June 2019 - May 2020</h2>
							<p><strong>I'm helping to create a patent-pending, market-bound smart toilet biomedical device to track urine and stool events in hospital patients.
							This project is a work in progress and I can't share everything on it yet due to patent development
							and other concerns. This page will be updated when possible.</strong>
							</p>						
							<hr />
							<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p> I am leading the <b>mechanical development</b> for a <b>smart toilet biomedical device.</b> 
								I've been using and developing my skills in rapid prototyping,
								design, machining, and sensor technology. I have designed and 
								constructed specialized mechanisms, automated testing systems, 
								and device prototypes. My work has helped our project receive over 
								$200k in seed funding from Duke Coulter and NC Biotech translational research grants.</p>
							<div align="center"><img src="images/toiletthumbnail.JPG" /></div>
								<p>This project is being developed as a collaboration between Duke University's DesignHub program and <a href="http://el.ladlab.org:8080/">the David Lab</a> at Duke University.
							<h2>Device</h2>
								<p>
								I have designed 3D models, generated toolpaths, and fabricated several prototype iterations of the device.
								I designed the prototypes for CNC milling and performed the CNC milling myself to enhance my design
								for manufacturing skills and decrease time between prototype iterations.
								My designs combine complex milled parts with 3D-printed mechanisms, electronic modules and existing mechanical parts
								all while keeping the device robust and compact enough to be used by patients in a hospital setting.
								</p>
								<p>
								I had a large influence on the mechanical components of the device, including shape, assembly, material choice, and processing.
								These design decisions were made to fit within ADA guidelines, ASME standards, feedback from hospital staff, and user feedback.
								</p>
							<h2>Analysis</h2>
								<p>
								I used FEA analysis in both Fusion 360 and SolidWorks in order to help select materials for the device, and decide how 
								thick or large certain components needed to be. We were careful to combine FEA results with real-life mini-experiments
								to verify that there were not improper assumptions in the simulations.
								</p>
							
							<h2>Hinge</h2>
								<p>I helped design a hinge for the device that reduces or eliminates the load put on it in specific orientations. I also am refining the design
								in order to be compatible with advanced fabrication methods.</p>
							<h2>Testing Rig</h2>
								<p>I designed and constructed a testing rig for our device. For ease of research and testing, we needed to mobile toilet that was
								identical to the wall-mounted ones in the buildings we were testing on. I quickly planned out a design with the toilet, brackets, bolts, and
								plumbing seals. I prepared a bill-of-materials and ordered the parts, and was able to assemble a wall-mounted toilet on wheels
								that could be easily transported and plumbed to a bucket.</p>
							<h2>Sensors</h2>
								<p>I have designed and fabricated a variety of sensor fittings and clips that allow the sensors to interface with our device properly. I am also using my knowledge
								of different sensor technologies to configure and calibrate sensors to improve the function of our device. Much of the sensor configuration
								was in Python, where I performed different signal processing methods on the sensor data to derive more meaning from it.
