							<h1>Eye Forceps</h1>
							<h2>November 2019 - Present</h2>
							<p><strong>I'm helping to develop a new tool that will help ophthalmologists perform a common surgery faster and more efficiently.
							Due to patent development concerns, exact details of the device will not be shared right now.</strong></p>
							<hr />
							<h2>Designing the Forceps</h2>
								<p>
								Dr. Mark Goerlitz-Jessen, an ophthalmologist at Duke's Department of Ophthalmology, came to me with a
								rough idea and sketch of a new set of forceps that would help him and others perform cataract complication 
								surgeries more effectively.
								</p>
								<p>
								I met with Dr. Goerlitz-Jessen multiple times to establish key design criteria for the first prototype of the 
								forceps and quickly designed a 3D model using Fusion 360 to meet these specifications. 
								</p>
							<h2>First Iteration</h2>
								<p>
								We printed the model at-scale using an SLA resin printer to establish that the proposed novel 
								mechanism for the forceps would work and be usable. Dr. Goerlitz-Jessen used the forceps on an artificial
								lens and verified that the mechanism works as intended.								
								</p>
							<h2>Second Iteration</h2>
								<p>
								The next step in validation for the forceps was to perform surgery on a pig eye. In order to make the forceps compatible with this
								operation, some tweaks were made to the original design. This new design was printed in metal. Due to the coronavirus epidemic,
								we have not been able to validate this design, but we plan on attempting the pig eye surgery in the near future.
								</p>
