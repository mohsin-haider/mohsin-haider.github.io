							<h1>My Story</h1>

							<p>As the son of a mathematician and an artist, growing up I felt that I was in the middle of a tug-of-war between two opposing and incompatible forces. Because I enjoyed math and science in elementary and school, I decided for myself, foolishly, that math had won the battle and that I was a <i>math kid.</i>  I avoided creative endeavors because I found them too ambiguous and figured<i> I just wasn’t a creative person.</i></p>
							<p>In middle school, however, I had my naive viewpoints challenged as I was introduced to something called <b>engineering</b>. For the first time, I was seeing words like <i>math</i> and <i>science</i> next to words like <i>design</i> and <i>creative process.</i> The juxtaposition piqued my interest and I decided to join the robotics team. Under the guidance of an amazing coach and surrounded by wonderful team members I found myself falling in love with the design process.</p>
							<p>In high school, although we didn’t have a competitive robotics team I explored my passions by working on the school’s 3D printers, starting and running a programming club, and working with school faculty to encourage more applicable engineering curriculum. A couple of engineering summer camps reinforced that it was the path for me.</p>
							<p>I chose Duke because of the care that is put into maintaining relationships between faculty and students, and the amazing variety of people that I have around me. I work at the Innovation Co-Lab, which is the campus’s center for anyone who wants to make anything. I thoroughly enjoy working on my own personal projects, as well as helping others navigate the makerspace to make their own. I’ve settled on <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> in order to gain important technical skills that I can use to enhance my design abilities, and I’m pursuing an <b>Innovation and Entrepreneurship Certificate</b> to focus on converting those technical skills into applicable and user-friendly products.</p>
							<p>I’ve realized that the tug-of-war that I imagined as a child wasn’t really pulling me apart. Instead I have found myself sitting happily in the middle, at the intersection of design and mathematics, with both pushing me forwards rather than pulling me in opposite directions. In the long term, I know that more than anything I want to <b>make things that solve problems.</b> Some fields especially interest me, such as biomedical devices and human-centric design, but I’m fully aware that the problems that I end up solving might be ones that don’t even exist right now.</p>
